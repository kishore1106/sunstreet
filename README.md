Sunstreet is a minimalistic blog template, specially made for Github pages and can be statically/dynamically served anywhere else too. You can view the demo from [here](http://marmoush.com) which is my personal blog.

### Usage Features
1. **Responsive** --- Try [screenify](http://screenify.com) to see how it looks on different devices.

2. **Minimalistic** -- The design was inspired by [Medium](http://medium.com), and [Slidebars](http://plugins.adchsm.me/slidebars/) demo website.
3. **Dynamic TOC** --- A dynamic table of contents  found in the right sidebar Inspired by [stackeditor](http://stackeditor.io).

5. **Code Hilighting** -- HighlightJS is included.
6. **Github API** ---  Since contents compiled on the fly this made it possible to also load any document found on github, such as projects' README.md, examples are in demo version.

## Contribution and Future features
Small Pull Requrests are much welcome, just don't forget to comment them, as for bigger PRs they might take longer time since I might not have time reviewing them all.

As for future plan here's a humble brain storm:

1. JS code modularity and pluggability.
2. ~~More reliance on `content.json` file instead of hardcoding any content, e.g disqus configurations~~ Done
3. More improvements on tests
4. ~~Continuous integration if necessary.~~ Done
5. ~~`content.json` validation~~ Done
